# useReducedMotion

A hook that returns `true` if the current device has Reduced Motion setting enabled.

const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion()

This can be used to implement changes to your UI based on Reduced Motion. For instance, replacing potentially motion-sickness inducing `x`/`y` animations with `opacity`, disabling the autoplay of background videos, or turning off parallax motion.

It will actively respond to changes and re-render your components with the latest setting.



<template>
  <Motion
    :animate="{
      opacity: isOpen ? 1 : 0,
      x: isOpen ? 0 : closedX
    }"
  />
</template>

## [Usage](#usage)

Import `useReducedMotion` from Motion:

import { useReducedMotion } from "motion-v"

In any component, call `useReducedMotion` to check whether the device's Reduced Motion setting is enabled.

const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion()

You can then use this `true`/`false` value to change your application logic.
